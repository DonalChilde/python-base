### Heading Levels

Normally, there are no heading levels assigned to certain characters as the structure is determined from the succession of headings. However, it is better to stick to the same convention throughout a project. For instance:

```text
# with overline, for parts
* with overline, for chapters
=, for sections
-, for subsections
^, for subsubsections
â€œ, for paragraphs
```
